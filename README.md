This short exercise demonstrates how to improve the readability of seasonal plots
by replacing numeric day-of-year (DOY) values with month-based labels on the x-axis. 
Using surface temperature data from the [Scottish Coastal Observatory at Stonehaven](https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/scottish-coastal-observatory-stonehaven-site), 
I show how even a small change in labeling can make time-series patterns easier 
to interpret â€” especially for broader audiences. The approach compares the default DOY labeling 
and an enhanced version with month separators and initials.
